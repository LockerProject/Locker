<h1>Editing a package.json for apps</h1>

<p>All apps need to have a package.json file to describe themselves with a few required fields. This is based on the <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages">CommonJS Packages</a> format and <a href="http://npmjs.org/doc/json.html">NPM</a>, with the additional data needed in the repository field.</p>

<h2>Minimum template to start</h2>

<pre><code>{
    "name": "myapp",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "description": "This is my awesome app!",
    "repository": {
        "title": "My App"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>name</code> field is a short name or 'handle', required but not visible anywhere.</p>

<p>The <code>version</code> is good to start with <code>0.0.0</code> and only increment the first two (x.x.0) if you want to track your own versions here, the last one (0.0.y) is auto-incremented every time an app is published.</p>

<p>Set <code>description</code> to a sentence describing what the app does in the gallery or details page before someone installs it.</p>

<p>For <code>repository.title</code> choose a short recognizable title (show in the list of apps after it's added).</p>

<h2>Screenshot</h2>

<p>The default screenshot used to describe the app is simply the <code>screenshot.png</code> file included with it.  The preferred size is 360x360, and it should represent what the app looks like in use (not an icon or cover).</p>

<h2>Optional repository fields</h2>

<p>To better describe what data an app needs in order to be useful, the uses field can express those requirements ahead of time:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "name": "myapp",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "description": "This is my awesome app!",
    "repository": {
        "title": "My App",
        "uses": {
            "services": [ "twitter", "foursquare", "instagram" ],
            "types": [ "places" ]
        }
    },
    "author": "My Name &lt;my@email&gt;"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Add any helpful or required services to the <code>repository.uses.services</code> array.</p>

<p>If any collections are used, add them to the <code>repository.uses.rypes</code> array.</p>

<p>By default the <code>author</code> is set to your github information when you publish, but you can override it here too.</p>
