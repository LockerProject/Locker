The "feeds" collection is all of the socially shared items across any service, facebook newsfeed, twitter timeline, foursquare recents, etc.

It consists of a primary type called an "item" which can have an array of "responses" that are comments, likes, retweets, etc from other people.

The goal is to dedup cross-posts to multiple networks from one person, particularly things like a foursquare checkin.
