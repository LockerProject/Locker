<h1 id="developer_quickstart">Developer Quickstart</h1>

<ul>
<li>Every runnable thing within the locker is it&#8217;s own web service (written in node, python, and ruby to start)</li>
<li>There is a core web service that coordinates stuff and handles startup, scheduling, etc</li>
<li>The types of services are generally: connectors, collections, and apps</li>
<li>Any service once it&#8217;s &#8220;installed&#8221; is assigned it&#8217;s own local directory for storing anything</li>
<li>Connectors are probably the best way to add value fast to the platform, the more places we enable getting data from the better</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="connectors">Connectors</h1>

<ul>
<li>Fundamental goal: mirror/sync data from somewhere else</li>
<li>Store that data in JSON in as identical-to-the-source structure as possible</li>
<li>Serve it back up via as simple of a RESTful API as possible</li>
<li>Be OK with being turned off anytime (graceful start)</li>
<li>Identify your data to the locker via simple service types (below)</li>
<li>Generate event notifications when data changes</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="collections">Collections</h1>

<ul>
<li>General common data-types (places, contacts, pages, music, photos, etc), there should be far fewer of these than connectors</li>
<li>Need to know how to speak service-types specific to the diverse set of connectors, understand the raw data formats</li>
<li>Embody the intelligence to merge and dedup from many sources, and handle local meta-data around each datum.</li>
<li>Register for event notifications to stay up to date efficiently</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="apps">Apps</h1>

<ul>
<li>Can talk to Connectors or Collections, whatever data they need</li>
<li>For now, primary interface is just via web browser</li>
<li>Should contain all resources needed locally</li>
<li>Do something awesome for the person with their data :)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="service_types">Service Types</h1>

<p>A &#8220;service types&#8221; system, mimic mime types for collections/connectors, connectors list what they require and produce, apps can list what types they need to work</p>

<p>A connector advertises which type it produces (page/safari-bookmark), and that type has a spec of common attributes expected within the data for the first part (page), the second part should describe the native format from the source of the data (safari-bookmark)</p>

<pre><code>place/facebook
place/foursquare
photo/flickr
contact/addressbook
page/safari-bookmark
page/safari-history
</code></pre>
